START TELLING YOUR STORY!

  Now, this is a story all about how
  My life got flipped-turned upside down
  And I'd like to take a minute
  Just sit right there
  I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
<br></br>
  In west Philadelphia born and raised
  On the playground was where I spent most of my days
  Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
  And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
  When a couple of guys who were up to no good
  Started making trouble in my neighborhood
  I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
  She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
  <br></br>
  I begged and pleaded with her day after day
  But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
  She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
  I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
  <br></br>
  First class, yo this is bad
  Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
  Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
  Hmmmmm this might be alright.
  <br></br>
  But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
  Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
  I don't think so
  I'll see when I get there
  I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
  <br></br>
  Well, the plane landed and when I came out
  There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
  I ain't trying to get arrested yet
  I just got here
  I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
  <br></br>
  I whistled for a cab and when it came near
  The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
  If anything I could say that this cab was rare
  But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'
  <br></br>
  I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
  And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
  I looked at my kingdom
  I was finally there
  To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
